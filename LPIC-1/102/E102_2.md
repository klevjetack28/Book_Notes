# Exercises 102.2

Both guided and exploration exercises of 102.2

## Guided Exercises

1. Default location for GRUB 2 configure file is `/boot/grub/grub.conf`.

2. You need to first edit the file `/ect/default/grub` then run the `update-grub` command to update the .conf file.

3. Manual entries can be added to the script files int the `/ect/grub.d/40_custom` directory.

4. `/boot/grub/menu.lst`

5. You can press `c` in the main menu and `Ctrl+C` in the editting window.

## Exploration Exercises

1. Unlike GRUB 2, GRUB Legacy both the disk *and* partition start at the zero index. So if you want the second partition you
will use one instead of zero.

2. You can use `fdisk -a /dev/sda/` to finf which partition is the boot partition.

3. You can list your disk uuid's with the `ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/` to list your disk and their uuid's. There are other filter
options such as `by-id` or `by-path`.

4. To update this script we would replace the line `set root=(hd0, 1)` with `search --set=root --fs-uuid 5dda0af3-c995-481a-a6f3-
46dcd3b6998d`

5. You can add the line `GRUB_TIMEOUT=` and set the value to 10 to `/etc/default/grub`.

6. `root(hd1, 0); setup(h1)` would be used to install GRUB Legacy through the GRUB shell.
