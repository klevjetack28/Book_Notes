# 103.4 Lesson 1 Exercises

Both the guided and exploration exercises for section 103.4 lesson 1. 

## Guided Exercises

1. `cat /dev/sdc > ./sdc.img`

2. The channel 1 is stdout. 

3. `set +o noclobber`

4. It will enter Heredoc mode and will only exit when a single '.' is entered. After the program finishes successfully it redirects the output to stdout.

## Exploration Exercises

1. The redirect `2>1` redirects stderr to a file named 1.

2. I assume it will because it does not save data anywhere. 

3. `sha1sum <<<$USER`

4. `ls -l /proc/1234/fd` will display the targets of all the symbolic links in the listed directory. 

5. `bc <<<"scale=6 1/3"`
