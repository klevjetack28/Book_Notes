# 103.3 Lesson 1

Both the guided and exploration exercises for chapter 103.3 lesson 1.

## Guided Exercises

1. 
    - The `d` in the output indicates that the file is a directory. 
    - The size is given in human readable format because we include the -h option. 
    - The output would only list the files in the current directory with no additional information. 

2. 
    - If the `cp` command is executed successfully the file `/home/frank/emp_name` will be copied into the `backup` directory. 
    - If the file is a directory then we would need to add a recursive option to the command. 
    - If the command was changed to mv I would expect the file to move into the `/home/frank/` directory and change the file name to backup. 

3. The * wildcard would delect everything in the current directory. 

4. Every file woukd be displayed because they all match the pattern. 

5. `$ ls file[1-4].txt`

## Exploration Exercises
