Both guided and exploration exercises for 103.1 lesson 2. 

## Guided Exercises

1. `export $PATH=/home/lukas/:$PATH`

2. By running the command `unset PATH` we can remove the PATH env variable. this change is only local and can be reverted by
openning a new terminal. 

## Exploration Exercises

1. Some examples of special characters could be spaces, parentheses, hashtags, ect. We can escape them in double quotes 
using a backslash prefex ('\') or with by using single quotes. 

2. With double quotes some characters have special meaning like the dollar sign in environment variables. The double quotes
interpret these as a variable. Single quote however treat every character as a literal.
