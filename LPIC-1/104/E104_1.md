# 104.1 Exercises

Both guided and exploration exercises for 104.1.

## Guided Exercises
    
1. GPT because MBR supports a maximum of 2TB. 

2. Use `p` for print. 

3. `mkfs.ext3 -c -L MyDisk -U random /dev/sdc1`

4. `mkpart primary ext4 500m 800m`

5. `mkfs.btrfs /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 -m raid1`

## Exploration Exercises

1. No because there is not 600 MB of continuous space. 

2. You would first run the command `resize2fs -M /dev/sdc1` followed by `resizepart 1 241M` to resize the partition. This is a two step process. 

3. You need to signal to the Linux system it is a swap partition and to do this you would ise the command `mkswap` not `mkpart`. 

4. You would use the `rescue` command with the correct start and end addresses. 

5. You would use fdisk to change the partition type to "Linux Swap" (82), then do any other changes before running `mkswap` to signal to the OS. Once everything is configures run `swapon` to enable.
