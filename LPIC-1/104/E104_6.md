# 104.6 Exercises

Both guided and exploration exercises for 104.6.

## Guided Exercises
    
1. The sticky bit in symbolic mode is `t`. We can use either the `-t` parameter or the `1` prefixing three chmod vlaues.

2. `$ ln -s /home/carol/Documents/document.txt text.txt`

3. A hard link is just a link to the same location in memory. If you copy a file you copy the data into memory in a different location. Hard links are represented with inodes to point to the same data location.

## Exploration Exercises

1. The soft like would stop working because it is path dependant.

2. The link would fail to create because you are trying to create a link over file systems.

3. There are three hard links on hte `document.txt` file. We can tell because every files start with 1 link and only hard link add to the link count. We can use the `-i` parameter to show which inode each file occupies.

4. The permissions would be `rw-r--r--` because the links always inherit the same access permissions as the target.
