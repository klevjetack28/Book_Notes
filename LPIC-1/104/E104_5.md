# 104.5 Exercises

Both guided and exploration exercises for 104.5.

## Guided Exercises
    
1.
```
$ mkdir emptydir
$ ls -lh
total 4.0K
drwxrwxr-x 2 lukas lukas 4.0K Jun 13 14:59 emptydir
```

2. 
```
$ chmod 744 emptyfile 
$ ls -lh
total 4.0K
drwxrwxr-x 2 lukas lukas 4.0K Jun 13 14:59 emptydir
-rwxr--r-- 1 lukas lukas    0 Jun 13 15:02 emptyfile
```

3. The default permissions for a umask of `027` would be `rwxr-x---` if it was a file and `rwxr-----` if it is a directory.

4. The permissions of the file would use the GID meaning the owner would have the permissions `rwx`. To remove the special permission you would issue the command `chmod 0755 test.sh` to remove the special permission.

5. The root user and anyone in the disk group can write to this file.

6. 
|**File Name**|**Symbolic Permissions**|**Octal Permissions**|
|-|-|-|
|Another_Directory|rwxr-xr-t|1755|
|foo.bar|---r--r--|044|
|HugeFile.zip|rw-rw-r--|664|
|Sample_Directory|rwxr-sr-x|2755|

## Exploration Exercises

1. Chmod treats the numeric values it recieve as the least significant digits. If the numeric value does not include any more values to the left it will fill those values in with 0s.

2. A user would not be able to delete any files from the directory except the files that they created themselves (or had ownership passed to them). /tmp is a shared directory so if a system has multiple users using the /tmp directory we would not want to allow other users with write permission to delete other users files.

3. We removed execution permissions for the user. The captial `S` in the permissions means that the SUID bit is set but the owner does not have execute permissions.

4. We would add the sticky bit for security and the SGID bit for group persistence.
```
$ chmod 3775 Box/
$ ls -lh
drwxrwsr-t 2 lukas lukas 4.0K Jun 13 15:24 Box
```
